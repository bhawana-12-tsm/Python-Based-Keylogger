This repository contains the code for a Python-based keylogger designed for educational purposes and ethical hacking practice. The keylogger monitors user activity by recording keystrokes, tracking mouse clicks, and taking periodic screenshots. It operates covertly, sending captured data to a designated email, and ensures persistence through system startup integration, making it ideal for learning about system vulnerabilities and data exfiltration techniques.

Key Features:

Captures keystrokes and mouse activity

Takes periodic screenshots

Sends captured data via email

Ensures persistence on system startup

Hides its presence from the user

Educational Purpose:
This project is intended to provide insights into the workings of keyloggers and their potential security risks. It is a hands-on tool for learning about system-level programming, ethical hacking, and detecting vulnerabilities in cybersecurity systems.

Ethical Use Disclaimer:
This keylogger is designed for educational use in controlled environments. It should only be used ethically and with explicit permission on systems you own or have authorization to test. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.

How to Use:

Clone the repository and install the required Python libraries.

Follow the instructions in the README to run the script on a Windows-based machine.

The keylogger will run invisibly and send the data to the specified email address.
